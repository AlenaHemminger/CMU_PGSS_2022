COLAB
help->search code snippets->import snippets to make easier
import items from google drive and set as functions to run. add columns
  better to use website of items rather than google drives though
  compare data such as min max and means in boxplots 
don't use dtale.. way too confusing
data sheet importing
  snippets again 
  set columns if off
  value-counts to run counts
R
im entirely too confused. copy and pasted what he did and it didn't run
